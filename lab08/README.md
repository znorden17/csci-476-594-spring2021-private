# Task 1

I think I did this right? I ended up mashing what we were given in the Lab08 readup and the code given in the book and making some sort of weird brain child. _Hopefully_ this is what I was supposed to get. Full code may be found in Task 1 of this github directory thingy.

I gave out the public key and the private key, I'm not sure if that matters but here you go. I tried to make it clear which was which. 


# Task 2

Wasn't sure if we were supposed to post the command to convert from ascii to hex, but I did just to be safe.

And then here's the xxd screenshot of decyrpting things.

Here's a more completed screenshot of me encrypting and decrypting things. It is kind of interesting that if you try to decrypt using xxd the encrypted message (6FB...) then it doesn't work and gives you gibberish, that's a nice layer of security. 


# Task 3

I was hoping that the encrypted message was an answer to a final lab question or maybe the amount that Travis is going to curve my grade. Sadly, this is not the case and I already knew the password to seed. Mildly disappointed. We had to do something for CSCI305 where we had to do something. and the information that we got was an answer to one of our midterm questions. 

But alas!

Anyway - I had fun with this one - it was super short and sweet. I never could get the python thing to work and the book was a major help for this lab.
