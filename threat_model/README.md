## Explanation

If the goal of the attack tree is to seize or access personal information from a laptop that I, as the laptop owner, left unattended, there are a couple ways I, as the attacker, could go about it. I'm sure I left a few ways that I'm not thinking of out and I wasn't super specific on some of the terminology. Otherwise, it should be pretty self explanatory.




## Strengths

A strength of using an attack tree is to easily see things laid out. You can see the different paths that an attacker might go about stealing information from your laptop. 



## Weaknesses

With an attack tree, and I feel like with most threat models, a pressing concern might be that you're missing an obvious (or seemingly obvious) way to getting into a laptop and seizing all those credit card numbers. 


## Improvements

First and foremost, I think I'd sit start with brainstorming. I went straight into reading and hopefully correctly copying, if you will, an attack tree. I'd probably start with just doing a web of all the things I needed to protect and how you could access them. For example, I stay logged into my Amazon account and have that "one-click to purchase" option on. That said, there's steps you'd need to get past before you could access that account. Second, I'm a big fan of asking other people for advice. Whether or not I take that advice, well, that's another thing entirely. Either way, I'd probably get together with other people and ask them what holes they saw in my plan. Say I missed the fact that my computer has a fingerprint scanner (which I now realize that I don't have on my plan, that's neither here nr there). A friend might've been able to catch that so I could add it to the list of potential ways to get into the computer.
