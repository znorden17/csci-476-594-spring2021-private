## Task 2


#### Task 2.1

The second image won't help you too much, but I wanted to throw that in there just in case.

#### Task 2.2

<details> <summary> Unhappy ranting about task, feel free to skip 2.2 </summary>
Just so everyone knows, I hate everything and everyone because I spent a good 20 minutes not figuring out why I couldn't get my essentially perfect curl command to work. I overlooked the itty bitty $ on the example. Which shows me that it's not from within my docker-thingy. Which sucks because I was *this* close to throwing my perfectly good desktop out the window. And then take a sludgehammer and smash whatever was left of it into tiny microscopic pieces. </details>

Anyway - snide comments aside, here's the screenshots for 2.2

#### Task 2.3

I've walked away, installed a punching bag, and then proceeded to bash my head into the punching bag for an hour. I feel much better and am ready to continue to contemplate bashing my computer into pieces.
