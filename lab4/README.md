## Task 2


#### Task 2.1

The second image won't help you too much, but I wanted to throw that in there just in case.

#### Task 2.2

<details> <summary> Unhappy ranting about task, feel free to skip 2.2 </summary>
Just so everyone knows, I hate everything and everyone because I spent a good 20 minutes not figuring out why I couldn't get my essentially perfect curl command to work. I overlooked the itty bitty $ on the example. Which shows me that it's not from within my docker-thingy. Which sucks because I was *this* close to throwing my perfectly good desktop out the window. And then take a sludgehammer and smash whatever was left of it into tiny microscopic pieces. </details>

Anyway - snide comments aside, here's the screenshots for 2.2

## Task 3

#### Task 3.1

Well, I've officially made Alice rich. I'm pretty sure this would also be a suspicious amount of money suddenly going to one person and if Aice was smart, she would slowly raise her salary once every 3 months or so but maybe a thousand, two thousand at a time. Not just jump it up to whatever she wanted at once. Not smart.

#### Task 3.2

And that's just cold-hearted and mean and lady, you are definitely getting fired.
