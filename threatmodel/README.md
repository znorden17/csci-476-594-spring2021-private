## Explanation

If the goal of the attack tree is to seize or access personal information from a laptop that I, as the laptop owner, left unattended, there are a couple ways I, as the attacker, could go about it. I'm sure I left a few ways that I'm not thinking of out and I wasn't super specific on some of the terminology. Otherwise, it should be pretty self explanatory.

## Strengths

A strength of using an attack tree is to easily see things laid out. You can see the different paths that an attacker might go about stealing information from your laptop.

## Weaknesses

With an attack tree, and I feel like with most threat models, a pressing concern might be that you're missing an obvious (or seemingly obvious) way to getting into a laptop and seizing all those credit card numbers.
