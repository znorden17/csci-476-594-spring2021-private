I wasn't sure if I need tod o the more advanced thing with the separate file or anything. Given that it didn't say so in the instructions, I will assume I did not need to do so. So far this seems very similar to the SQL injection thing that we did on the last lab. What was really weird was that I couldn't enter a different message. I had to enter XSS, so I'm not sure why that was the case? 

I tried to put in "Heyo, this is the answer for Task 1." and it wouldn't work. I wonder if it has to be a one word answer?
