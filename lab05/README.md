I wasn't sure if I need tod o the more advanced thing with the separate file or anything. Given that it didn't say so in the instructions, I will assume I did not need to do so. So far this seems very similar to the SQL injection thing that we did on the last lab.

Is it possible to do a more advanced version of this using the larger script file thing and then insert a video or something? I wouldn't be able to get it to work with the existing field because I'd run into a character limit on my space, but I should be able to run something if I tossed it into a file to run. I am curious if I could get the actual video to pop up or if it'd just be the link to the video, which wouldn't be as funny.

I still don't quite understand the dangers behind cookies.

I can kind of see why knowing this info would be dangerous though. 


## Task 4

### Task 4.1

Our first image is pre-friend Boby and the second image is after we've added Boby as a friend.

Now here's a code block of the code that I inserted. There is also a screenshot of the full code snippet below that textblock of code. From what I understand, this code looks at the url and then goes to add friend withthe id number of 57. 

`var sendurl="http://www.xsslabelgg.com/action/friends/add" + "?friend=57" + token + ts;`

### Task 4.2

For task 4.2 I was unable to successfully re-add Boby as a friend. To try and accomplish this, I removed the code from the "edit HTML" section and just directly pasted it in Samy's bio. I also removed Boby as a friend before I used this attack to verify things. I was unable to readd Boby as a friend if I just pasted it in the normal About me field. As you can see from the screenshots, I am still friendless.

## Task 5

Once again, we will be targetting poor Boby. As you can see from the screenshot below, Boby has a very poor MySpace-esque profile page. Let's see if we can't spice things up. You know, once he visits Samy's profile.
