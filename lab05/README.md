I wasn't sure if I need tod o the more advanced thing with the separate file or anything. Given that it didn't say so in the instructions, I will assume I did not need to do so. So far this seems very similar to the SQL injection thing that we did on the last lab.

Is it possible to do a more advanced version of this using the larger script file thing and then insert a video or something? I wouldn't be able to get it to work with the existing field because I'd run into a character limit on my space, but I should be able to run something if I tossed it into a file to run. I am curious if I could get the actual video to pop up or if it'd just be the link to the video, which wouldn't be as funny.
