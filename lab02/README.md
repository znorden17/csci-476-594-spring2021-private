According to the book, if I run bash it shouldn't print something out unless I declare it. So we should be good here. 

## Task 2


#### 2.1

This was interesting because it doesn't consider the foo command thingy that I did in task 1 as an environment variable with the website and the HTTP viewing thing. 

#### 2.2.1
![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab02/screenshots/2_task2.2.1.png)

basically allows us to view things. 

#### 2.2.2

Allows us to change the user-agent.

#### 2.2.3

So it does the exact same thing it looks like as -v but adds a refer to a url.

#### 2.2.4

Adds a header of some kind
#### 2.2.5

So I think the only that can inject is technically -e because it refers you to a url or something. I think -H also adds something and so -A.

## Task 3

#### 3.1

#### 3.2

#### 3.3

#### 3.4

#### 3.5

Assuming that "steal" means to view them or maybe export them to a different file (which you can do by adding a > test.txt at the end and then going to cat test.txt), you should not be able to do this. I think it's because that we aren't the root ID. If we were root, we probably could do this.
