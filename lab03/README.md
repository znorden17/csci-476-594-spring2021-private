#### 1.2

The code creates a new shell that we can run commands from as if we were running them from seed@VM. What was interesting is that it looks like the id/whoami commands read the same as if we were seed@VM.

#### 2.2

# TODO: take screenshot of numerous segfault errors. 

I was unable to complete this portion of the lab however. If this was working I would expect to gain access to root because we overwrite the memory of the program. Which would lead to a change of execution of path, which damages files and would give us access to private info. 


## Task 3
