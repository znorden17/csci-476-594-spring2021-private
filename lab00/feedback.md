Re: bidirectional clipboard, you may need to install "Guest Additions". I think this was mentioned in the SEED setup instructions, but if it wasn't you can do a little googling and should come up with some info. It is pretty straightforward. Let me know if you have questions - I can try to help you troubleshoot if you get stuck!

And yes, I am a morning person :-)
