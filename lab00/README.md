## 3 Lessons

1. I learned that Reddit uses either Markdown or something very similar to Markdown. 
2. Supposedly the clipboard is bidirectional. I have yet to actually get it to work.
3. SSH's are not based on repositories but instead of machines. 
4. Travis Peters is a very organized person and most definitely a morning person.
