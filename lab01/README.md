##### 1.2

I'm going to be honest, I don't entirely understand this.

The full files for 2.1 and 2.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/code/myprintenv/myenv1) and [here](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/code/myprintenv/myenv2), respectively.

I'm going to be honest - I can't really tell the difference. 

##### 2.3

There are no differences between myenv1 and myenv2. Because we used fork, we duplicated the parent process and made like an exact clone.

## Task 3


#### 3.1

I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what this did because I can't actually see anything happen. And there isn't a new file (besides the executable) that I can just open up. 

#### 3.2

Oh wow. Okay, this kind of looks like the myenv1 and myenv2, I wonder if it does the same thing as the earlier code we ran but just differently. I'm going to be honest though, I have no idea what I'm actually looking at. 

#### 3.3

The first call we did was fork() which did the parent/child thing. Where they're basically the same thing. If I'm understanding this right, the second one we did in task 3.2, I think is exec() where we replace the original process with a copy. Execute and replace. But like, execute-execute, kill-execute.
