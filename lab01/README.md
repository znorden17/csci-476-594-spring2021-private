## Task 1

##### 1.1 

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_10.png)

##### 1.2

I'm going to be honest, I don't entirely understand this.

## Task 2

##### 2.1

##### 2.2 

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_13.png)

The full files for 2.1 and 2.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/code/myprintenv/myenv1) and [here](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/code/myprintenv/myenv2), respectively.

I'm going to be honest - I can't really tell the difference. 

##### 2.3 

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_17.png)

There are no differences between myenv1 and myenv2. Because we used fork, we duplicated the parent process and made like an exact clone.

## Task 3


#### 3.1

I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what this did because I can't actually see anything happen. And there isn't a new file (besides the executable) that I can just open up. 

#### 3.2
![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_18.png)

Oh wow. Okay, this kind of looks like the myenv1 and myenv2, I wonder if it does the same thing as the earlier code we ran but just differently. I'm going to be honest though, I have no idea what I'm actually looking at. 

#### 3.3

The first call we did was fork() which did the parent/child thing. Where they're basically the same thing. If I'm understanding this right, the second one we did in task 3.2, I think is exec() where we replace the original process with a copy. Execute and replace. But like, execute-execute, kill-execute. 

## Task 4


![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_19.png)

I have no idea what this is actually doing. Maybe showing me all the paths I can take for stuff.

## Task 5

#### 5.1

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_20.png)


#### 5.2

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_21.png)

#### 5.3

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_23.png)

I honestly don't think I exported things correctly. I thought when I exported this there would be more noticeable changes with what I did, because I didn't do this correctly, (or so I believe) I did not get those obvious changes. 

## Task 6

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_23.png)

Running this one was entertaing because I kept remaking the directory with different names because all it did was run the linux command ls. Which lists all the stuff in a directory. Which, if I wasn't doing this this late at night, that would make total sense, but because I'm sleep deprived it didn't occur to me to actually read the code I was supposed to be copying to make this command. Not my brightest day.

## Task 7

#### 7.1

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_25.png)

Yeah, I spelled myprog wrong and then... I didn't bother changing it. But it produced "I am not sleeping", so I'm not sure if that's right or wrong

#### 7.2

Will return for this task 

#### 7.3

What was very interesting on this one is when I changed directories it kept giving me the error about things that cannot be preloaded. Will return to the rest of the this later.

## Task 8

#### 8.1
![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_26.png)

I don't think I can all you're doing is taking advantage of cat. All cat does is lets you read a file. 

#### 8.2

No, they don't. Considering I can't get it to run since I have an implicit declariation, it defintely does not work. 

## Task 9

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/screenshots/Screenshot_27.png)

I did not provide a screenshot, but when I sudo su the thing it still doesn't let me take ownership of the file or anything or at least run it the way I'm supposed to. I'm willing to bet that it's supposed to change things around and modify /bin/zzz but because I'm doing something wrong, it won't let me. 

# Notes

I'm going to be honest, 45% of this went straight over my head.
