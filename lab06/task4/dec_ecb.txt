Antiochus XII Dionysus Epiphanes Philopator Callinicus (Ancient Greek: á¼ˆÎ½Ï„Î¯µÍcÑmnEQ/ãÇ½Ï…ÏƒÎ¿Ï‚ á¼˜Ï€Î¹Ï†Î±Î½Î®Ï‚ Î¦Î¹Î»Î¿Ï€Î¬Ï„Ï‰Ï ÎšÎ±Î»Î»Î¯Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï‚; between 124 and 109 BC â€“ 82 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as King of Syria between 87 and 82 BC. The youngest son of Antiochus VIII and, most likely, his Egyptian wife Tryphaena, Antiochus XII lived during a period of civil war between his father and his uncle Antiochus IX, which ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII in 96 BC. Antiochus XII's four brothers laid claim to the throne, eliminated Antiochus IX as a claimant, and waged war against his heir Antiochus X.

By 87 BC, only two claimants remained, both brothers of Antiochus XII: Demetrius III and Philip I. The realm of Demetrius III was initially centered in Damascus but later extended over most of Syria. Demetrius III was defeated by Philip I and went into exile in Parthia, allowing Antiochu.
