I'm not sure why it's giving me "hex string is too short, padding with zero bytes to length". I thought it might be the key being to short, but if I change the length of the key, it tells me that "hex string is too long, ignoring excess". It also tells me that the hex string is too short in the same line, so who knows? I sure don't. 

Anyway - even though it's too short or whatever, I do still have encrypted things.
