Ta-da! 


## Task 2


#### Task 2.1

The second image won't help you too much, but I wanted to throw that in there just in case.

## Task 3

#### Task 3.1

Well, I've officially made Alice rich. I'm pretty sure this would also be a suspicious amount of money suddenly going to one person and if Aice was smart, she would slowly raise her salary once every 3 months or so but maybe a thousand, two thousand at a time. Not just jump it up to whatever she wanted at once. Not smart.

#### Task 3.2

And that's just cold-hearted and mean and lady, you are definitely getting fired. I used the same command as before but modified slightly to target the person named Samy (which is spelled wrong, should be Sammy).

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab04/screenshots/task3.2.3.png)

I wonder if there's a way to narrow things down further? I suppose I could directly target the employee ID of Samy. The only reason I bring it up is because it would be unfortunate if there was this receptionist or something also named Samy who also got their salary dropped to 1. Unless SQL has a priority thing? Like the first Samy we find we're going to change the password of?


#### Task 3.3

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab04/screenshots/task3.3.1.png)

Hopefully you can see the changes that we made, I tried to get the ending screenshot thing but as you can see there is a before and after for the password. I also really hope you never ask me to login because I have no idea what I set it to. I suppose I could just reset it. 

It was interesting to have to use the sha command. It makes sense that you would have to encrypt it, but it's interesting that you can't just enter a raw password change. 


## Task 4

#### Task 4.1

![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab04/screenshots/task4.1.1.png)
![image](https://github.com/znorden17/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab04/screenshots/task4.1.2.png)

There we go, that's the code. I tried logging in with Admin '# which is what I used last time and it wasn't super happy about that, as you can see. It was kind of interesting that there wasn't all that much code needed to actually prevent an SQL injection. So that was kind of neat.
